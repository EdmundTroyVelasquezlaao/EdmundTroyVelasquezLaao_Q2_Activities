     <b>
      Members of about 37 species are referred 
      to as foxes, of which only 12 species actually 
      belong to the Vulpes genus of 'true foxes'.</a></b> By far 
      the most common and widespread species of fox is the 
      red fox (Vulpes vulpes), although various species are 
      found on almost every continent. The presence of fox-like 
      camivores all over the globe has led to their appearance in 
      both popular culture and folklore in many cultures 
      around the world (see also Foxes in culture). 
      The gray fox is one of only two canine species known 
      to climb trees, the other is the raccoon dog
